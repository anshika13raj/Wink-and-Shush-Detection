# Wink-and-Shush-Detection
The Wink & Shush Gesture Detection System is a computer vision project that leverages OpenCV and NumPy to detect specific user gestures (wink and shush) from real-time video input. The system demonstrates the use of image processing and feature extraction techniques to process video frames efficiently and identify gestures with high accuracy.

This project showcases the integration of real-time data acquisition, signal processing, and computer vision algorithms for human-computer interaction applications.

🎯 Objectives

Detect and classify wink gestures in real-time.

Identify shush gestures (finger-to-lips action) with robust accuracy.

Implement real-time video frame processing with noise reduction.

Enable gesture-based interactions for future applications (e.g., accessibility tools, silent control systems).
